## 4. Abilities and Powers  

As an **A‑Class** hero, Narcisstoic is a skilled, powerful fighter capable of both bare‑handed combat and improvised weapons. He can eliminate three monsters in rapid succession and performed a high‑stakes support role in a rescue mission. His body shows no visible scars after crushing monster fangs and skeletons. However, against Demon‑level monsters (e.g., Rhino Wrestler) he is relatively ineffective.

- **Enhanced Speed** – High agility; during his signature move **Soft Touch Execution**, he throws a rose into the air, defeats several mysterious beings, and catches the rose by mouth before it lands.  

### 4.2 Fighting Style  

- **Hand‑to‑Hand Combatant** with an “elegant” style.  
- **Soft Touch Execution** (ソフトタッチエクスキューション, *Sofutotacchiekusukyūshon*): A barrage of punches, knee strikes, and improvised weapons; demonstrated by eliminating three monsters and catching a tossed rose mid‑air【5】.  
- **Rose American Sack** (ローズメリケンサーック, *Rōzumerikensākku*; Viz: *Rose Brass Knuckles*): Uses brass knuckles in combat【6】.
